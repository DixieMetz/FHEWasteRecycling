# Confidential Waste Recycling

A privacy-preserving waste management and recycling tracking system built on blockchain technology using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure data confidentiality while enabling statistical analysis.

## 🌍 Core Concept

The Confidential Waste Recycling platform revolutionizes waste management by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to create a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for waste tracking and recycling data analysis.

### Key Features

- **🔒 Privacy-First Design**: All sensitive waste data is encrypted using FHE technology, ensuring individual privacy while enabling aggregate statistical analysis
- **📊 Confidential Analytics**: Perform computations on encrypted data without ever revealing the underlying information
- **♻️ Comprehensive Tracking**: Monitor multiple waste categories including plastic, paper, glass, metal, and organic waste
- **⚡ Energy Impact Measurement**: Track energy generation and carbon reduction from recycling activities
- **🌐 Blockchain Transparency**: Immutable records on the Sepolia testnet ensure data integrity and auditability

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Encryption**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
